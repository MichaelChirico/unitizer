# Release Steps

## 1.4.18

[x] Add tests for upgrade blocking test output.
[x] Check 289 using "fansi_1.0.1"  # won't fix
[x] Make sure there is no way to force accept upgrades in non-interactive (or at
least that it's not a problem).  Seems like it might be doable with some
combination of auto.accept and force.update (maybe), but then if you're using
those non-interactively...

## Standard

[ ] Coverage

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[ ] R CMD check --ascran
[ ] winbuilder    r81416
[ ] CI
[ ] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")
[ ] R 3.2
[ ] R 3.3
[ ] Review documentation

Github Actions doesn't work anymore with the default Rstudio setup, so we've
just been running locally on our 3.3 version (or on docker?).

[ ] Revdep
[ ] CRAN policy
