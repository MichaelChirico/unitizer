unitizer 0.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

* Can now run tests in clean environment (i.e. objects from .GlobalEnv will not
  be visible) (issue #13)
* Can now run tests with clean search path (i.e. only the basic R libraries are
  loaded) (also issue #13), use `unitize(..., search.path.clean=TRUE)`
* New vignette "Reproducible Tests" discusses the above features

Bugfixes:

* Expressions printed as tests evaluated now truncated corretly (issue #4)
* Incorrect displaying/hiding of ignored tests in some circumstances fixed

Other Improvements:

* Summary no longer includes "removed" tests in matrix, since those are section-
  less
* Other minor clean-up of the interactive environment prompting
