Warning in check_call_stack() :
  It appears you are running unitizer inside an error handling function such as 
`withCallingHanlders`, `tryCatch`, or `withRestarts`.  This is strongly dis-
couraged as it may cause unpredictable behavior from unitizer in the event tests
produce conditions / errors.  We strongly recommend you re-run your tests 
outside of such handling functions.
Warning in history_capt(history) :
  Unable to capture history in non-interactive mode.
| 4/4 tests passed; nothing to review.

Error in check_call_stack() : 
  "unitizerInteractiveFail" restart is already defined; unitizer relies on this 
restart to manage evaluation so unitizer will not run if it is defined outside 
of `unitize`.  If you did not define this restart contact maintainer.
