\title{Data Produced During Evaluation of \code{`unitizer`} Test}
\description{
Kept separate from the \code{`\link{unitizerItem-class}`} because these
are the slots that get compared from the new item to the reference items
which means there are a whole bunch of other classes that need to have the
same structure as this and by definining it we let those other classes
confirm they have the correct structure.
