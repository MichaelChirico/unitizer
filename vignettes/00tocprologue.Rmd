## TL;DR (Prologue)

`unitizer` bakes in a lot of contextual help so you can get started using it without wading into this rather lengthy vignette.

The best way to get started is to review the interactive demo (with a [companion vignette](02democompanion.html) if you are into documentation):
```
library(unitizer)
demo(unitizer)
```
Or alternative, review the [introduction vignette](00introduction.Rmd).

## Table of Contents

### [Introduction](01introduction.html):

Explains the motivation for developing `unitizer`, compares it to other unit testing frameworks, and provides a quick start guide.

### [Demo Companion](02democompanion.html):

Provides additional details and documentation for the included interactive demo.

### [Details On Tests](03tests.html):

Delves into the details of what constitutes a test in `unitizer`, how to modify how new tests are compared to reference values, how to organize your tests into sections, how to test different aspects of expression evaluation (e.g. stdout, stderr, etc.).

### [The Interactive Environment](04interactiveenvironment.html)

Reviews the `unitizer` prompt, highlights differences with the standard R prompt, explains the different `unitizer` commands, discussing the `.new` and `.ref` `unitizer` objects, and introduces some of the complexities of `unitizer` evaluation environments.

### [Reproducible Tests](05reproducibletests.html)

By default `unitizer` runs expressions in an environment that does not inherit from `.GlobalEnv` and with a search path reduced to the standard search path of a fresh R session.  This vignette discusses how this is done and potential implications for your tests.

### [Nitty Gritty](06nittygritty.html)

Covers a number of estoric topics, including:

* More details on `unitizer` environment structure
* Alternate Store Locations
* Overridden functionality
* `unitizer` and eversion control
