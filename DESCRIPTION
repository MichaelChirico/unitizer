Package: unitizer
Title: Turn Arbitrary Code into Unit Tests
Description: Stores objects produced by test scripts so that they
    can be compared with each development iteration.  Test scripts need
    only execute the code that is supposed to work, `unitizer` takes care
    of the rest.
    The first time a test script is run, the user interactively
    verifies that the values produced by the script are as expected.
    Subsequent runs will compare the new values to the old ones, and
    alert if anything is different.  `unitizer` will even store errors
    so that you can verify the same code reproduces the same errors.
    The major advantage of this set-up relative to other testing
    frameworks is that it greatly simplifies assertions designed to
    test complex output since the previously run correct output
    generates the assertions.
