unitizer 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* More comprehensive state tracking and resetting; in particular:
    * Random.seed, options, and wd are now tracked in addition to search path
    * State reset during test review to what it was
    * State stored in `unitizer` to alert of changes if there is an error
    * Cleaner less intrusive shimming
* Function parameters tweaked
   * Technically API breaking, but mostly cosmetic and done now given the
     package is not in broad use
* Vignette updates
* Demo update

unitizer 0.9.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements / Changes:

* Complete restructure of internal test management to allow for much more robust
  `unitize_dir` behavior (#51)
* Added `testthat` -> `unitizer` translation utilities
  (see `?testthat_translate_file`)
* Can now pre-load objects before unitizing; `unitize_dir` and `unitize` by
  default auto-preload files in subdir 'helper'
* Renamed arg `env.clean` to `par.env` (technically API breaking, but since no
  one is using this package yet...)
* Many usability fixes (#48, #68, #82, #83), and improved text display
* Improved path inference to better guess desired unitizer based on partiallly
  specified file names (#72)

Other

* `unitize_dir` works with empty dirs (#78)
* Better management of file locations and names (#35, #75)

unitizer 0.8.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugfixes

unitizer 0.8.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* Added ability to accept multiple tests at once (Issue #45, use wisely...)
* `unitize` can now infer partially specified test file names (in particular,
  will know to look in `pkgname/tests/unitizer`; see `?infer_unitizer_location`)
* `parse_with_comments` no longer run in non-interactive mode (#63)
* Test call now part of output of test object `show` method (#54)

Bugfixes:

* Comments inside `unitizer_sect` preserved (#64)

Internal:

* `search_path_cleanup` more robust (#59)
* `get_text_capture` tests added (#60)


unitizer 0.7.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

unitizer 0.7.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvements:

* Parsing speed improved (Issue #15)
* Got rid of `get*` functions, instead, access test details with `.NEW`/`.REF`
  (Issue #29)
* Implemented `editFunNames` to allow user to modify stored calls in `unitizer`
  so that tests can be re-used even if function names are changed

unitizer 0.6.5

Improvements:

* Comment parsing faster (issue #15)


Bugfixes:

* Reference section logic improved (assume fixes #36 until there is evidence
  against)

unitizer 0.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:

* Added a demo (`demo(unitizer)`)

* `unitize_dir` allows you to run all tests in a directory (issue #24)
* `review` allows you to review and drop tests from an existing `unitizer` store
  (issue #21)
* Test navigation mechanism improved (issue #26)
    * Typing R at the unitizer prompt now allows you to review all tests
    * You can skip ahead too
* `unitize(..., force.update=TRUE)` will overwrite unitizer even if there were
  no changes recorded (issue #19)

Behavior changes:

* `unitize` now runs with `search.path.clean=TRUE` by default

Bugfixes:

* Comparison function warnings not captured (issue #14)
* Search path restoration error messages fixed (issue #22)

  loaded) (also issue #13), use `unitize(..., search.path.clean=TRUE)`
* New vignette "Reproducible Tests" discusses the above features

Bugfixes:

* Expressions printed as tests evaluated now truncated corretly (issue #4)
* Incorrect displaying/hiding of ignored tests in some circumstances fixed

Other Improvements:
